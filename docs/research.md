## Assumptions
- maintainer do have territorial behaviour [paper]
- adding words is marking
- deleting of non-maintainer words is defending

## 1. QUESTIONS
- focus on metrics for territoriality, not on ones for maintainance template usage!!!!!
- turn: share of changes (deletes, adds) on all tokens
- look if the success rate over time is constant. if an editor was approved in the past time, does he have an higher chance to get approval now? like for FA review for example
- differences between single-editor and multiple-editor ownership http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Ownership_of_articles#Types_of_ownership
- territoriality in the meanings of ownership of words/tokens in wikipedia articles by editors

## 2. IS THE MAINTAINER TERRITORIAL ON THE ARTICLE
- Q: is the editorhsip unequally distributed?
- Q: Does first clash of opinions (i. e. first sprint phase with counter phase) lead to an owner?
- Q: does an maintainer have an stronger social standing or even more, formed a supportive peer group around him compared to others
   - re-introduction of maintainer tokens by others: could also be a good metric for quality of edits
- Q: Does an maintainer behave differently, in protecting and marking territory?
   - ratio of antagonistic to supportive actions different 
- Q: Does the template tag lead to less diversity of editors and owner?

### a) DOES THE MAINTAINER DEFEND THE ARTICLE?
- Q: Are there overproportional number of undo by the maintainer? 
    - isnt the actag action metric better?
    - Q: How old are the words defended?
- Q: Are there overproportianal number of antagonistic actions by the maintainer against others?
- Q: does a maintainer tend to delete tokens from newbies?
   - check edits done by editors with IP instead of registered username
**Limitations**

### b) DOES THE MAINTAINER MARK THE ARTICLE?

**Limitations**

## 3. WHAT EFFECTS DOES TERRITORIALITY HAVE?
- Q: Does this lead to better quality of article?
- Q: Does it lead to a more diverse, inclusive collaboration?
- Q: maintained articles have more activity? (felix said so)
**Limitations**

## 4. WHY AND HOW DOES MY WORK MATTER?
Q: How visible is marking for other editors?
