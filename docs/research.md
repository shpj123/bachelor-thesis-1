## Brainstorming
**Ways of using power to gain territory**
- attack others: weaken opponents
- establish, control and use norms: shape framing
- defend intrusion: guard ownership
- mark explore new fields: 
=> no theoretical foundation
=> territoriality is primarily related to the space where it is happening (inside the territory or outside, whatever you act), power is primarily a social process between actors (for or against, wherever you act)=> so are the concepts and terms used in both perspectives!

**typical sequence**
1. Someone marks a non-claimed territory to be his own
	- marks
2. Someone else marks the same territory and a conflict over ownership may appear
	- shape the framing
	- marking
	- defending

**Assumptions**
- maintainer do have territorial behaviour [paper]
- adding words is marking
- deleting of non-maintainer words is defending

## GENERAL
- turn: share of changes (deletes, adds) on all tokens
- territoriality as meant as ownership of words/tokens by editors in wikipedia articles
- use absolute or relative data of actions for calculations?

"Territoriality in humans is best understood as a spatial strategy to affect, influence, or control resources and people, by controlling area; and as a strategy, territoriality can be turned on and off." [Human Territoriality: Its Theory and History, Sack]

"Territoriality serves a communicative function by signaling to other actors in the space that there is an individual or group that has taken ownership of a given territory or object (e.g “This is my space, not yours.”) (Brown, G., Lawrence, T.B., and Robinson, S.L. Territoriality in Organizations)" => **citation not prooven!**

"The basic expression of territoriality is marking, the placement of an object or substance into a space to indicate ownership of one’s territory. Territoriality can also be expressed through defense, actions that serve as a response to a perceived invasion of an established territory." [Brown, G., Lawrence, T.B., Robinson, S.L., 2005. Territoriality in Organizations. The Academy of Management Review 30, 577–594. doi:10.2307/20159145]

## 1. IS THE MAINTAINER TERRITORIAL ON THE ARTICLE?
- **Territoriality is a strategy executed in space**
- **Territoriality is social and geographical**
- **People who exercise control must be inside the territory**
- **=> Territory is the article, actors are the editors in it.**

### a) DOES THE MAINTAINER MARK THE ARTICLE?
**Direct territorial actions!**
**Positive Freedom**
- H: Does the maintainer have more edits? 
	- Q: is the editorhsip unequally distributed?
- H: Does the maintainer add more tokens? 
	- T: absolute and relative
	- T: Look at self-supportive actions: self-redeletes and self-reintroductions
	- Q: Is the number and share of tokens owned from maintainers overproportional?
- H: Does a maintainer edit talk pages more? [paper]
	- Q: are there any typical fighting words used to own the talk page?
	- Q: Does the maintainer forbid editing or justify own undos?
	- H: Do maintainers start the featured article or good article process?
		- Q: does it lead to FA, at least candidate status?
		- kommt es innerhalb eines bestimmten zeitraumes dazu? im schnitt wieviele edits??
			- Q: How long after the maintainance template does it happen in average?
	- H: Does a maintainer add more templates related to him?
		- Q: How many templates does a maintainer add per article compared to other editors? => ratio
- H: Does a maintainer undo deletes and re-deletes of tokens (re-introductions)?
	- of all tokens, not just his ones, cause territory is the article, not his tokens. can also be seen as marking
- H: is semi-protection or protected used over-proportionally?

### b) DOES THE MAINTAINER DEFEND THE ARTICLE?
**Direct territorial actions!**
**Negative Freedom**
- H: Does the maintainer have more antagonistic actions (deletes and undos)?
	- T: also look at deletes, re-deletes and re-introductions seperate.
	- T: exclude self-related actions from antagonistic actions
	- T: look at share of antagonistic actions of maintainer to all his actions
	- T: compute window with x revisions and x days
	- Q: is he targeting specific user groups: top-level authors, newbies?
	- Q: ratio of antagonistic to supportive actions different 

## 2. WHAT PATTERNS/EFFECTS DOES TERRITORIALITY HAVE?
**Problem with patterns: Not connected to a theory!**
- Q: Does it lead to less diversity of editors and owner?
	- Q: Editorship GINI
- Q: Does it lead to more or less activity? [paper Felix]
- Q: Does the behaviour differ on different page types?
- Does the number of tokens increase after maintainance template introduction? [paper felix]
- Pattern found: Introduction of maintained tag leading to the implementation of ’good’ or ’featured’ tag after a significant amount of revisions [paper felix]
- Pattern found: Introduction of maintained tag leading to an increase of the number of words and the number of authors [paper felix]

**No**
- Q: Do Maintainers have more constant contributions?

**Further Research**
- Q: Does first clash of opinions (i. e. first sprint phase with counter phase) lead to an owner?
- Q: does a maintainer have a stronger social standing or even more, formed a supportive peer group around him compared to others?
   - re-introduction of maintainer tokens by others: could also be a good metric for quality of edits
- Q: How old are the words defended?
- H: Does he use condensed edits to restructure/change a lions share of the articles content?
	- Q: Does a sprint have some special pattern of interaction? Heavy deletion at the beginning? 
	- Does this lead to a maintainance template, or is this already happening during the usage? => would an answer add any value, cause the causal relations behind can never be found out?
- Q: Does the behaviour of non-maintainers change after introducing template tag, especially of top editors?
	- which metrics to use?

## 3. WHY AND HOW DOES MY WORK MATTER?
- Is it possible to quantify marking and defending of territory in wikipedia articles?
- Find out, which actions are used for defending territory (marking, defending, attacking, norms)?
	- Find out, which ones are helpful and harmful? => reinforce helpful, reduce harmful
- Understand mechanisms and patterns of power in controlling discourse
- Offer support for editors during editing
	- critical, cause can reinforce territoriality
	- maybe especially helpful for newbies: tell, when they delete old tokens, or ones owned by the maintainer, to inform about potential antagonstic action.
- Offer foundation for possible policy adaptations

## Test Hypotheses
- Comparison between articles with and without maintainance tag.
- Comparison between time before and after template implementation
	- M/O Split (show M and O seperatly and difference between both as plot)
- differences in different article types?
	- look at similiar pages => i. e. biographies, literature, physics, biology, cities in germany, nation-states, etc 

**Steps:**
- http://wiki.alpine-geckos.at/wiki/Wissenschaftliches_Schreiben
- http://wiki.alpine-geckos.at/wiki/Wissenschaftliches_Arbeiten
- Fix assumptions, data sample, limitations, metrics and hypothesis
- Create results

## Critique
**Critique = Limitations = Further Research**
- has an editor with many edits in an article automatically higher numbers in relevant metrics?
- looking back window is constructed
- do bots play a role?

**Limitations**
- collaborative interactions between editors in english wikipedia
- only use articles, where maintainer is no admin
- only use articles, which are not protected or semi-protected
