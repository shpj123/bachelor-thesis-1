- "Hecht and Gergle (2010a) studied 25 language pro jects and found that the articles present in all the pro jects represent only 1% of the total, when 74% of the articles were present in one language only." [p. 9]
- "The global structure of the pro ject, measured as a network, the no desb eing the articles and the links the links b etween the articles, seems also to b e the same, in terms of degree distributions, growth, topology, reciprocity, clustering, assortativity, path lengths, and triad significance profiles, at least for the main pro jects (ZlatiÂ¢ et al., 2006)."

- "However, it seems that the percentage of contribution coming from the users having privileges (administrators of Wikipedia) which are the biggest contributors, is decreasing with the age of the project (Kittur et al., 2007a; Ortega and Gonzalez Barahona, 2007; Ortega et al., 2009). " [p. 19]
-  "In the other hand, their contributions dominate what people see when visiting Wikipedia (Priedhorsky et al., 2007): The top 10% of editors by number of edits contributed 86% of the PWVs [p ersistent word views], and top 0.1% contributed 44% nearly half ! The domination of these very top contributors is increasing over time.

- "Laniado and Tasso (2011), completed this point, using English Wikipedia's dump data, finding evidence of the presence of a nucleus of very active contributors, who seem to spread over the whole wiki, and to interact preferentially with inexp erienced users." [p. 19]
