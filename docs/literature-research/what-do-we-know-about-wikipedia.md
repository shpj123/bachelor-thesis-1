- "Hecht and Gergle (2010a) studied 25 language projects and found that the articles present in all the projects represent only 1% of the total, when 74% of the articles were present in one language only." [p. 9]
- "The global structure of the project, measured as a network, the nodes being the articles and the links between the articles, seems also to be the same, in terms of degree distributions, growth, topology, reciprocity, clustering, assortativity, path lengths, and triad significance profiles, at least for the main pro jects (ZlatiÂ¢ et al., 2006)." [p. 10]
- "Regarding the activity of each of these registered authors, it has been shown that the number of article per authors follows a power law (Voss, 2005), " [p. 19]
- "However, it seems that the percentage of contribution coming from the users having privileges (administrators of Wikipedia) which are the biggest contributors, is decreasing with the age of the project (Kittur et al., 2007a; Ortega and Gonzalez Barahona, 2007; Ortega et al., 2009). " [p. 19]
-  "In the other hand, their contributions dominate what people see when visiting Wikipedia (Priedhorsky et al., 2007): The top 10% of editors by number of edits contributed 86% of the PWVs [p ersistent word views], and top 0.1% contributed 44% nearly half ! The domination of these very top contributors is increasing over time.

- "Laniado and Tasso (2011), completed this point, using English Wikipedia's dump data, finding evidence of the presence of a nucleus of very active contributors, who seem to spread over the whole wiki, and to interact preferentially with inexp erienced users." [p. 19]

- "Finally, Halfaker et al. (2009) showed that the number of reviews a word survives is a strong predictor of whether the edit that removes the word will be reverted (p. 9)." [p. 26]
- "In any case, there is a core-periphery structure, similar to the one found in open source software production, and things are easier when the core team people already know each others: Nemoto et al. (2001)"[p. 30]
