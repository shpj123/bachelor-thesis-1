### Citations
- "These behaviors, if left unchecked, may deter cooperation due to turf wars and conflicts over ownership." [p. 1]
- "In an online community, issues relating to control and possession can arise when social actors inhabit a shared space. As a result, territoriality, the expression of ownership toward an object, is likely to emerge as community members work together to accomplish a common goal [4]" [p. 1]
- "territoriality serves a communicative function by signaling to other actors in the space that there is an individual or group that has taken ownership of a given territory or object (e.g “This is my space, not yours.”) (Brown, G., Lawrence, T.B., and Robinson, S.L. Territoriality in Organizations)" [p. 1]
- "These signals can shape interaction within a space through the demarcation of the boundaries between social actors in the environment [4]. The basic expression of territoriality is marking, the placement of an object or substance into a space to indicate ownership of one’s territory (Brown, G., Lawrence, T.B., and Robinson, S.L. Territoriality in Organizations)." [p. 1]
- "Our interviews reveal a management style that relies on the application of territorial markers to communicate one’s expertise and commitment to other community members as a way to both deter vandals and to welcome new editors - but only on the maintainer’s terms." [p. 2]
- "The public expression of one’s commitment and possessive feelings towards the article suggest that Maintainers do indeed employ this particular template as a marker of territoriality, despite the explicit warnings against ownership found within the template guidelines." [p. 2]
- "Territoriality can also be expressed through defense, actions that serve as a response to a perceived invasion of an established territory (Brown, G., Lawrence, T.B., and Robinson, S.L. Territoriality in Organizations)" [p. 3]
- "We observed the appropriation of wiki functionality, particularly the ability to easily change pages back to a previous version, for defensive means. All interviewed participants actively monitored their Maintained articles by watching page change updates to look for article vandalism and more substantially, to revert edits that they deem unsatisfactory due to quality issues such as incorrect information or assertions made without proper citations." [p. 2]
- "And you'll say [via Talk pages], no, you have bad ideas. You should leave the article alone because you don't know what you're talking about...You're protecting the article because you do feel it's yours...But it IS my article. It is my baby. (P3)" [p. 3]
- "each of the Maintainers interviewed had a particular editing style, consistent with primary editorship, again despite explicit policies warning against such behavior." [p. 3]
- "I would rather contribute, you know, finished, more finished product than the smaller bits of information...And, a lot of people just like to contribute a paragraph here, a citation there. (P7)" [p. 3]
- "Having a primary contributor who is intimately familiar with the history of an article may also have value in explaining why an article is the way it is, to help newcomers understand the article’s structure or to resolve disputes." [p. 4]

### Notes
- differences in process: piece by piece contributions versus holistic, structural one with approach of synthesis and hermeneutic 
- policy tells to not behave territorial
- existing opportunities are used to defend articles
- can deter new members/entries
- are markers for editors really the solution, or just an internalization of hierarchy?
