The basic expression of territoriality is marking, the placement of an object or substance into a space to indicate ownership of one’s territory. Territoriality can also be expressed through defense, actions that serve as a response to a perceived invasion of an established territory [Brown, G., Lawrence, T.B., Robinson, S.L., 2005. Territoriality in Organizations. The Academy of Management Review 30, 577–594. doi:10.2307/20159145]
- mark: positive territoriality (is my definition)
- defend: negative territoriality (is my definition)
