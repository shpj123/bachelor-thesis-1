Territoriality serves a communicative function by signaling to other actors in the space that there is an individual or group that has taken ownership of a given territory or object (e.g “This is my space, not yours.”)

The basic expression of territoriality is marking, the placement of an object or substance into a space to indicate ownership of one’s territory. Territoriality can also be expressed through defense, actions that serve as a response to a perceived invasion of an established territory [Brown, G., Lawrence, T.B., Robinson, S.L., 2005. Territoriality in Organizations. The Academy of Management Review 30, 577–594. doi:10.2307/20159145]
- mark: positive territoriality (is my definition)
- defend: negative territoriality (is my definition)

**Questions:**
- is an add a positive relation to the authors of the content where the add was done? difficult: if you add something to a paragraph, it could be an support to the existing meaning as it could be a critique to it.
